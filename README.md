# RhizomeBot

Peer to Peer Botnet in Kotlin

<p align="center"><img height="375" width="276" src="rhizome.jpg"></p>

RhizomeBot is my attempt at a peer to peer botnet written in Kotlin. This project is very much in progress. The features I plan to implement are:

- Restricted Route Networking
- Encrypted config
- Control of network through a single RSA keypair
- Stealthy communication channels

At the moment, this project is just starting. A bot can connect to another bot and receive unauthenticated commands.
